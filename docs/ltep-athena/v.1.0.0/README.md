# LTEP Athena © Developer Portal

Welcome to the LTEP AThena developer portal! Here you'll find all the resources you need to build your amazing Data Science and Automation projects using our API for convinient delivery to your Stakeholders.

## LTEP Athena Philosophy

We believe that Datascientists and Automation Engineers shall not be limited by any Tools and be free to create easy solutions according to their stakeholders needs. From our perspective this maximal flexibility and liberty is only possible if the engineers can use their own code. At the same time, comprehensive Analytics and Automations shall not be complex to access and use. With these two ideas in mind, we created the LTEP Athena © Platform to bridge these at first glance contrary ideas. Try LTEP Athena © and convince yourself.
