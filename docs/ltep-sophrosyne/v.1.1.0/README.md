# LTEP Sophrosyne © Developer Portal

Welcome to the LTEP Sophrosyne developer portal! Here you'll find all the resources you need to get started setting up your automated and self-governed data-center

## What is LTEP Sophrosyne?

Sophrosyne complements your data center monitoring by allowing it to automatically react to alerts. It integrates in any monitoring ecosystem like Prometheus where alerts can make REST-Calls. It offers flexible APIs for triggering actions (any piece of software) countering the source of an alert. By doing so, it bridges the gap between automated error detection through alerts and the subsequent manual problem solving by administrators and developers. Additionally, it offers extensive customization, logging and management possibilities through an integrated Web-UI.
