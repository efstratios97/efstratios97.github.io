# Control Panel

Once Sophrosyne is in use, the list of Actions and Dynamic Actions can grow fast. Additionally, you might not want to give to every user the same access to all actions. Therefore, we introduce the Control Panel. The Control Panel comprises different dashboards that consist of Actions selected by an administrator and are assigned to an individual user or multiple users. With Control Panels you manage who can access and trigger actions while offering a tidy and clear overview of these allowed actions

## Create a Control Panel

Creating a Control Panel involves three steps:

1. The first step involves the creation of a so called Control Panel Dashboard Group. A Control Panel Dashboard Group consists of Actions & Dynamic Actions grouped together to the users requirements.
2. The created Control Panel Dashboard Group(s) can now be assigned to a Control Panel Dashboard. A Control Panel Dashboard is a single view comprised of a selection of Control Panel Dashboard Group(s).
3. The created Control Panel Dashboard can now be assigned to a Control Panel which can be assigned to an individual user or user(s)

<h3>1. Navigate to Control Panel Management Menu</h3>

First navigate to the Control Panel Management Menu (1)

<div style="text-align: center">

</div>

<h3>2. Initiate creation of a new Control Panel Dashboard Group</h3>
Use the toolbar (2) to initiate the creation of a new Control Panel Dashboard Group. We recommend to start from the inner component of a Control Panel. The Control Panel Dashboard Group is a sub-component of a single Control Panel Dashboard.

<h3>3. Initiate creation of a new Control Panel Dashboard</h3>
Use the toolbar (3) to initiate the creation of a new Control Panel Dashboard. The Control Panel Dashboard is the main component that brings a selection of multiple Control Panel Dashboard Group(s) together. A Control Panel can have multiple Control Panel Dashboards, which an user can navigate through.
