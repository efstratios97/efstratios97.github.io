# Control Panel

When Sophrosyne is in active use, the number of Actions and Dynamic Actions can quickly increase. Additionally, access control is often required so that not every user can trigger every action. To address this, Sophrosyne provides the **Control Panel**.

The Control Panel consists of dashboards that group together selected Actions and Dynamic Actions. These dashboards are managed by administrators and assigned to individual users or groups of users. This structure ensures clear access control and provides users with a clean overview of the actions they are permitted to execute.

## Control Panel Components

A Control Panel is built from three hierarchical components:

1. **Control Panel Dashboard Group**  
   - The smallest building block.  
   - Contains a set of Actions and Dynamic Actions organized according to user requirements.

2. **Control Panel Dashboard**  
   - A higher-level view that combines one or more Dashboard Groups into a single interface.  
   - Users can navigate through multiple dashboards assigned to them.

3. **Control Panel**  
   - The top-level structure.  
   - Consists of one or more Dashboards.  
   - Assigned to one or multiple users, defining their complete set of accessible actions.

## User Perspective

From the userâ€™s perspective, the Control Panel provides a simple interface consisting of one or more dashboards. Each dashboard presents only the Actions and Dynamic Actions the user is permitted to access. Users can switch between dashboards if multiple are assigned to them.

### Summary

- **Dashboard Groups** organize Actions and Dynamic Actions.  
- **Dashboards** combine groups into navigable views.  
- **Control Panels** define which dashboards (and thus which actions) a user can access.  

This modular structure allows administrators to efficiently manage permissions while keeping the user interface clear and organized.
